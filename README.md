# Mythical Critters
Each exercise emphasizes the fundamentals of object oriented programming in Apex.

## Installation Steps
- Start by "forking" this repo.
- Then sign up for a new Developer Org here - https://developer.salesforce.com/signup
- Once you've verified your org and set up your credentials, create a new project with manafest in VS Code and connect it to your new dev org.
- Once there, set your git origin to the Mythical Creatures repo that you forked.  Once you're connected, pull down the master branch.  

## Running the Tests
All of the tests are commented out.  Work through the critter classes in the order outlined below creating supporting Apex classes for each set of requirements.  

## Some Important Notes
- Aside from a few tests methods which require you to create your own tests, You should not edit any of the test class content aside from uncommenting the code in each one.
- You will *not* be creating any of the classes in the Salesforce OBject Manager.  All of these tests should be satisfied using Apex based classes.

### Imagine Two Critters
Can you add two new critters to the repository? How about a Hydra? Add unit tests exercising some of the following concepts:
